# MIPS32 Assembly Beginner Programs

Programs I'm working on to learn MIPS32 Assembly.

## How to Start

1. Launch QtSpim
2. Load program file
3. Step through program with F10 key

Tip: After running a program, you need to do a few things to reset for running it again (or running a new program).

1. Simulator --> Clear Registers
2. Simulator --> Reinitialize Simulator
3. File --> Load File

If you encounter errors, open Simulator --> Settings. Make sure that the MIPS tab shows Bare Machine as being unchecked and Accept Pseudo Instructions as checked.

## Programs

- FizzBuzz: Classic FizzBuzz problem
- Miscellaneous Programs
  - AddLoop: Use a loop to increment a value
